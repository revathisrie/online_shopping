                    Since the rise of large internet-based e-commerce sites, the growth of online shopping has been exponential,
                     with a huge increase in the number of consumers choosing to buy online rather than in-store.
                     Here are some of the reasons why online shopping is better than purchasing in-store.

                <h4> EXTRA PRODUCTS ONLINE </h3>
                <p >
                    It is no secret that most stores have a larger amount of stock online than at their physical locations. 
                    Due to the capacity of warehouses and the space constraints of local stores, you can often access a much larger range of products online, 
                    and search buttons make it even easier to find the products that you want in a minimal amount of time.

                <h4> DISCOUNTS AND VOUCHER CODES </h3>
                <p >
                    Although it is often rare to find an in-store voucher unless the store is hosting a special event, 
                    many retailers offer a copious amount of discounts and voucher codes to be used online as part of their marketing promotions.

                <h4> HOME DELIVERY </h3>
                <p>
                    This makes internet shopping much more convenient as you can simply find the product that you want from any location and
                     with options such as same day or next day delivery available- have this delivered to your door. This is extremely beneficial to individuals 
                     who struggle to walk far or have a disability that prevents them from journeying to the shops as regularly as they would like.
