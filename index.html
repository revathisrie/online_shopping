                    Since the rise of large internet-based e-commerce sites, the growth of online shopping has been exponential,
                     with a huge increase in the number of consumers choosing to buy online rather than in-store.Many traditional retailers have also followed suit, 
                     with most shops now having a dedicated e-commerce website from which consumers can make online purchases, from high street brands to charities. 
                     Even brands which no longer exist on the high street are often available online.
